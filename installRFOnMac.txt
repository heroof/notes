1 - `brew install python`
2 - relogin to terminal so it will point to brew's python
3 - `pip install virtualenv virtualenv-wrapper`
4 - virtualenv-wrapper will drop a `mkvirtualenv` function script somewhere, need to source that in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`

next time you can do `mkvirtualenv` and create python 2 or python 3 isolated environments
using `workon` command you can switch to env like, `workon mySeleniumEnv`
when you are in particular environment, pip commands will affect only that
if you mess something up or it is broken, no need to worry, make new env
